# Ground Water Quality Assessment Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes ground water quality using machine learning algorithms. It evaluates various physicochemical parameters and applies multiple ML models to assess water quality and predict its usability.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Attributes:**
  - pH
  - TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)
  - Hardness
  - Chloride
  - Nitrate
  - Sulfate
  - Fluoride
  - Turbidity
  - Conductivity
  - Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
  - Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
  - Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
- **Data Source:** [Provide source or mention if self-collected]
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, normalization, and feature selection.

## 🔍 Machine Learning Models Used
The following ML algorithms were applied to assess water quality:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Naïve Bayes
7. XGBoost
8. LightGBM
9. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
10. Gradient Boosting

## 📈 Results & Analysis
- A **bar graph** visualizes the performance of different models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Feature importance was analyzed to identify key factors affecting water quality.
