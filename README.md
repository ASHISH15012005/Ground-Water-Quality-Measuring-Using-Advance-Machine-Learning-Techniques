  - Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
  - Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
- **Data Set:** [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ok9cUM5_nl7Cf9kzaA07UolvnuVF3Scs/view?usp=drive_link)
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, normalization, and feature selection.

## 🔍 Machine Learning Models Used
The following ML algorithms were applied to assess water quality:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Naïve Bayes
7. XGBoost
8. LightGBM
9. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
10. Gradient Boosting

## 📈 Results & Analysis
- A **bar graph** visualizes the performance of different models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Feature importance was analyzed to identify key factors affecting water quality.
